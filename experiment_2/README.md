# In this 2nd Data Challenge, we are going to take our python functions used for processing photometry and transit searching and apply them to the target lists for "Known" planets in this repository.

# In the end, we'll compare the planet periods and radii measured by BLS and TLS to the values listed in the catalog ("pl_orbper" and "pl_rade").
